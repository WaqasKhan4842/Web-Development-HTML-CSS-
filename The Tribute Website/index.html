                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on <span class="bold"><time datetime=""></time>December 25, 1876,</span> in Karachi, 
                        which was then part of British India. 
                        He was the eldest of seven children. His father, Jinnahbhai Poonja, was a prosperous merchant.
                        After receiving his early education in Karachi, Jinnah moved to England at the age of 
                        16 to study law at <span class="bold">Lincoln's Inn</span>,
                        one of the most prestigious law institutions.
                        He returned to India in 1896 as a barrister, ready to establish his legal career.

                    <p>
                        Jinnah's early years were shaped by his exposure to British political systems, which played a significant role 
                        in his understanding of law and governance. His passion for justice, combined with his sharp intellect,
                        allowed him to build a successful legal career. 
                        These early experiences laid the foundation for his future political journey.

             <h3>Role in Pakistan's Creation</h3> 
                <p>
                    Jinnah's role in the creation of Pakistan is monumental. Initially, he joined the <span class="bold">Indian National Congress</span> in 1906, 
                    advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity and reforms in British India. 
                    However, over time, he became disillusioned with Congress's policies, particularly the lack of attention to Muslim rights. 
                    In 1913, Jinnah joined the  <span class="bold">All India Muslim League</span> and became its most prominent leader.
                </p>
                <p>His leadership culminated in the historic <span class="bold">Lahore Resolution</span> of 1940, where the demand for an independent 
                    Muslim state was formally adopted. As the chief architect
                    of this vision, Jinnah tirelessly negotiated with British officials and the Indian Congress for a separate nation. 
                    His unwavering commitment and strategic diplomacy led to the creation of Pakistan on  <span class="bold">August 14, 1947</span>.
                </p>
            <h3>Leadership Qualities</h3>
                <p>
                    Quaid-e-Azam was renowned for his <span class="bold">integrity, determination, and visionary leadership</span>. 
                    He exhibited an extraordinary ability to lead with dignity and fairness, advocating
                    for the rights of all citizens, regardless of religion or ethnicity.
                    His leadership style was pragmatic yet principled, focusing on achieving results without
                    compromising on core values.
                </p>
                <p>One of his most notable qualities was his <span class="bold">unwavering faith</span>
                    in the cause of an independent Muslim state. Despite numerous challenges, 
                    including health issues and political opposition, Jinnah remained committed to the vision of Pakistan. 
                    His famous principles of <span class="bold">Unity, Faith, and Discipline</span> became guiding pillars for the nation he founded.
                </p>
            <h3>Legacy</h3>
                <p>
                    Quaid-e-Azam's legacy as the <span class="bold">Father of the Nation</span> remains strong to this day. 
                    He not only established Pakistan as an independent state but also set forth 
                    a vision for a democratic, progressive, and inclusive society. His speeches, particularly those
                    emphasizing <span class="bold">religious freedom, rule of law, and equality for all</span>, 
                    continue to inspire generations of Pakistanis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jinnah passed away on <span class="bold">September 11, 1948</span>, just over a year after the creation of Pakistan, 
                    but his influence remains profound. His life is a testament to the power of leadership, perseverance, 
                    and vision in achieving the seemingly impossible.
                    Today, his legacy is honored as the <span class="bold">founding father</span> whose leadership and foresight gave birth to a nation.
